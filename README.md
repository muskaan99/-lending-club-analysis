## CONCLUSION

The Exploratory Data Analysis helped look at the Lending Club data in depth. The following conclusions can be drawn from EDA:

1) There are arouand 47.63% of loans which are paid off loans and 11.88% are charged off loans from the time period of 2007 to 2018.

2) The Lending Club makes around 19% profit on fully paid loans. Also, it is able to only recover approximately 58% of loans that are defaulted.

3) The interest rates are in accordance with the Lending Club policy i.e. it is correctly imposing higher interest rate for lower grades starting from D to G and has less interest rates for grades like A, B and C.

4) Lending Club should focus on states like California, New York, Texas, Florida and Illinois as these are the states from where most number of loans are taken.

5) A majority of customers have no public derogatory record. Having more than 1 derogatory record increases the possibility of charged off loan.

6) Investigate the case where the interest rate for number of charges equal to 5 is lower than the interest rate as compared to the case of no charge offs. Investigate further in the case of funding amount being more for number of charge offs equal to 4.

7) Lending Club should invest in loans with purpose like Education, so as to increase profits as it has no defaults till date.

8) The lower range of FICO Score(low) for grade A is a lot more than other grades indicating it is a good FICO score. Customers with no defaults have their FICO score(high) higher as compared to the other grades.

9) Lending Club can take steps to restrict itself by reducing its investments in cases where the loan amount is greater than 10,000 and number of delinquencies is greater than 3 as they are not safe.

10) A and B have a low DTI ratio as compared to the poor grades like E,F and G which have a high DTI ratio indicating a lot of debt.A low DTI ratio shows a balance between debt and income indicating A and B grades are good.
